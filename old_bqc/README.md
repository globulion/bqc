A Happy Quantum Chemistry Program

This is simple program which is designed to:

* computation of energries and wavefunctions of closed and open shell systems
* computation of NMR spectra

Now implemented features:

* Basis sets: cartesian GTFs of types s, p, d, f
* RHF/UHF-DODS calculations
* CIS calculations for singlet excited states (closed shells only)

This program is based on the material from "Handbook of Computational Quantum Chemistry"
of David. B.Cook
